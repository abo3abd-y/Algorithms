Hello! This is my first \LaTeX\ document.

A rectangle has side lenghts of $(x + 1)$ and $(x + 3)$.
% this is how you enter the math mode: surround things with $
The equation ${A(x)=x^2+4x+3}$ gives the area of the rectangle.
% This ^ gives you an error without the math error.
% {} means that the equation is in one line instead of seperating it in both lines.
The following is in displayed math mode $$f(x) = x^2+2x+1$$
